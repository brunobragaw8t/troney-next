## General guidelines

- In all interactions, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Plans

At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Styling
