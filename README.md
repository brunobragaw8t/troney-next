# Troney

Reworking this in Next.js. Original project [made with Nuxt](https://github.com/brunobragaw8t/troney).

Troney (word-play for tracking money) is an expense tracker web app focused on a
simple and fast UI to keep my life on track.

Some of its features are:

- Record earnings, expenses and movements;
- Separate money by wallets;
- Organize expenses with buckets and categories;
- Monthly graphs;
- Keyboard shortcuts for navigating the UI.

Here's a [demo](https://troney-next.netlify.app/).
